title: "0001: Keep docs and decisions in the repo"
description: Durable project docs live in docs/ as Starlight-compatible Markdown, strong decisions get records, and commits carry code, tests, and docs together.

## Context

Decisions, specs, and plans that live in chat history or in someone's head get lost, and coding agents drift from intent they cannot read. Humans and agents need one place to learn what the product does, why it works that way, and how each change was planned, and that place has to change in step with the code.

## Options considered

1. **Markdown in the repo**: versioned with the code, readable by every agent, reviewed in the same pull request as the change.
2. **An external wiki or tracker** (Notion, Confluence, issue threads): richer editing for non-engineers, but it drifts from the code and agents cannot see it without extra tooling.
3. **A docs framework from day one**: a rendered site immediately, at the cost of tooling before there is content.

## Decision

We keep durable docs in the repo as Markdown with Starlight-compatible frontmatter: living feature specs in `docs/specs/`, decision records in `docs/decisions/`, change plans in `docs/plans/`, product docs in `docs/product/`, and engineering guides in `docs/guides/` as each domain gets real policy. A Starlight site can render these files later without rewriting them.

Every commit is atomic: the code, its tests, and the docs it changes land together. Strong decisions get a record in `docs/decisions/`; records are superseded, never rewritten.

The owner chose:

- **Structure**: default
- **Viewable site**: Markdown only
- **Product docs**: vision only (the plugin is open source; no pricing page)
- **Changelog**: `CHANGELOG.md` by hand, Keep a Changelog format

## Consequences

- Agents read the relevant spec and decisions before changing behavior, and reviewers see doc changes next to code changes.
- Updating a spec or writing a decision record is part of each change, which costs a few minutes per change.
- Specs describe current behavior only; planned behavior lives in plans until it ships.

## Revisit when

People who do not work in the repo need to edit docs directly, or the structure stops matching how work is planned.
